       My name is Van Nguyen. I was born in 1993 in Hanoi, Vietnam. My interest with photos started to grow during my last year of high school. Now I'm participating class of Photography at Art & Design Institut in Prague, Czech republic. My work is focused mainly on food as a photographer and as a food stylist. I don't run food tour, but you still can find my reviews and guide on instagram.<br>
